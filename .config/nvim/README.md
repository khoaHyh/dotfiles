# Neovim config

Mostly using neovim these days as a commandline editor but every now and then I like to use it as a
secondary driver when developing. I've been plugin-happy but have also tried to keep it sane without
too much bloat. I think my goal atm is to trim as much fast as possible so that I don't have to debug
my config every month :-(. 

### TODOS

* Add and setup lsp, linter, formatter, autocomplete and autosuggestions
    * would like this for: golang, javascript, typescript, tsx, css, lua, c, yaml
